## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the MedPrompt AI Chatbot up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.9+
  * `pip` (Python package installer)

### 1\. Obtain API Keys üîë

The application requires API keys for Google Gemini and Mistral AI to function.

  * **Gemini API Key:** Obtain yours from the [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).
  * **Mistral API Key:** Get your key from the [Mistral AI Platform](https://console.mistral.ai/).

Once you have your keys, create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project (e.g., `MedPrompt AI Chatbot/.env`) with the following content, replacing the placeholder values with your actual API keys:

```dotenv
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
MISTRAL_API_KEY=YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY
```

**Security Note:** Remember to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent your API keys from being accidentally committed to version control.

### 2\. Dataset Information üìö

The MedPrompt AI Chatbot's RAG system is built upon a knowledge base derived from medical textbooks. While this project uses a custom dataset, the [MedQA-USMLE Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moaaztameer/medqa-usmle) is a relevant public medical dataset that can be referenced or used for similar applications.

### 3\. Set Up Pre-processed Data üóÉÔ∏è

The chatbot relies on pre-processed medical text chunks and a FAISS index for its RAG capabilities. You have two convenient options to obtain these:

#### Option A: Download Pre-built Data (Recommended) üëá

You can directly download the `medical_faiss_index.bin` and `medical_text_chunks.pkl` files from the following Google Drive link. After downloading, **create a new directory named `medprompt_ai_data` in the root of your project and place these files inside it**:

[MedPrompt AI Data on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qzZlyx77mZ5Dq64Dwgz_7GUkgqQMsyg-?usp=drive_link)

#### Option B: Generate Data Using `model.ipynb` üßë‚Äçüíª

If you prefer to generate the data yourself, you can run the `model.ipynb` notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

  * ***Recommendation:*** Utilize a **T4 GPU runtime** in Colab for significantly faster processing.
  * This notebook will guide you through:
    1.  Installing necessary libraries.
    2.  Downloading NLTK data (handled automatically by the notebook).
    3.  Mounting your Google Drive to access your medical textbooks (you'll need to provide your own `.txt` medical textbook files in a folder like `Medical_Textbooks` on your Google Drive).
    4.  Processing the textbooks, generating embeddings, and building the FAISS index.
    5.  Saving `medical_faiss_index.bin` and `medical_text_chunks.pkl` to your specified `SAVE_DIR` (e.g., `/content/drive/MyDrive/medprompt_ai_data`).

Ensure these generated files are then accessible to your `app.py` (e.g., by placing them in a `medprompt_ai_data` folder in your project directory).

### 4\. Install Dependencies üì¶

You can install all the required Python packages using `pip`.

#### Method 1: Using `requirements.txt` (Standard)

If you have a `requirements.txt` file (which lists all project dependencies), simply run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Method 2: Installing Directly via `pip` (Alternate)

Alternatively, you can install each core dependency by listing them in a single `pip install` command:

```bash
pip install flask python-dotenv google-generativeai sentence-transformers faiss-cpu nltk numpy requests scipy
```

#### Method 3: Using a Virtual Environment (Recommended Best Practice) üêç

It's highly recommended to install dependencies within a virtual environment. This isolates your project's dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

1.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
      * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
      * On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
3.  **Install the dependencies within the activated environment:**
    ```bash
    pip install flask python-dotenv google-generativeai sentence-transformers faiss-cpu nltk numpy requests scipy
    ```
    Once installed, you can run your application. To exit the virtual environment, simply type `deactivate`.

### 5\. Run the Application ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Once you have set up your API keys and the data files, you can launch the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start, and you can usually access it by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

**Note:** For production deployment, it is recommended to use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn instead of Flask's built-in development server.

-----

## üí¨ Usage

1.  **Access the Chatbot:** Open your web browser and go to the address where the Flask app is running (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
2.  **Ask a Question:** Type your medical question into the input box at the bottom of the chat interface.
3.  **Send Message:** Press `Enter` or click the send button (the paper plane icon) to submit your question.
4.  **Receive Response:** The AI will swiftly process your question, retrieve relevant context, and synthesize a comprehensive answer, which will be streamed to the chat interface.
5.  **Voice Input/Output:**
      * Click the **microphone icon** to speak your question directly.
      * Click the **volume icon** to toggle voice output for the AI's responses on or off.
6.  **New Chat:** Click the **"New Chat" button** to start a fresh conversation at any time.
