Question- What are the symptoms of viral fever?



### **Future Improvements:**

#### **1. Persistent and Scalable Conversation History**

Problem: Conversation histories are stored in an in-memory Python dictionary (conversation\_histories). This has two major drawbacks:



All chat histories are lost whenever the server restarts.



It will not scale if you have multiple users or deploy the application across multiple server instances.



Solution:

Replace the in-memory dictionary with a persistent database. A NoSQL database like MongoDB or a simple key-value store like Redis are excellent choices for storing conversation data.



How to Implement (using Redis):



Install the Redis Python client:



Bash



pip install redis

Update app.py to connect to Redis:



Python



import redis

import json



\# ... (other imports)



\# Connect to Redis (assumes Redis is running locally on the default port)

redis\_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0, decode\_responses=True)



\# ...



@app.route('/ask', methods=\['POST'])

def ask\_medprompt\_ai():

&nbsp;   # ...

&nbsp;   session\_id = request.json.get('session\_id')



&nbsp;   # Retrieve history from Redis

&nbsp;   history\_json = redis\_client.get(session\_id)

&nbsp;   conversation\_history = json.loads(history\_json) if history\_json else \[]



&nbsp;   conversation\_history.append({"role": "user", "parts": \[{"text": user\_question}]})

&nbsp;   # ... (rest of your logic)



&nbsp;   # Save updated history back to Redis

&nbsp;   redis\_client.set(session\_id, json.dumps(conversation\_history))



&nbsp;   # ...



#### **2. Asynchronous Task Handling**

Problem: The /ask endpoint performs several time-consuming operations sequentially: encoding the user's question, searching the FAISS index, and making two separate API calls to external language models. This can lead to long wait times for the user and potential request timeouts.



Solution:

Make the external API calls asynchronous. This will allow your server to handle these I/O-bound operations more efficiently.



How to Implement (using asyncio and aiohttp):



Install aiohttp:



Bash



pip install aiohttp

Refactor app.py to use async/await:



Python



import asyncio

import aiohttp



\# ...



async def query\_mistral\_model\_async(prompt, session):

&nbsp;   # ... (your existing logic, but using session.post)

&nbsp;   async with session.post(MISTRAL\_MODEL\_API\_URL, headers=MISTRAL\_HEADERS, json=payload) as response:

&nbsp;       # ...

&nbsp;       return await response.json()





@app.route('/ask', methods=\['POST'])

async def ask\_medprompt\_ai():

&nbsp;   # ...

&nbsp;   try:

&nbsp;       async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:

&nbsp;           mistral\_task = asyncio.create\_task(query\_mistral\_model\_async(mistral\_full\_prompt, session))

&nbsp;           # Note: The 'google-generativeai' library supports async out of the box

&nbsp;           gemini\_response\_obj = await gemini\_model.generate\_content\_async(

&nbsp;               gemini\_conversation\_history,

&nbsp;               # ...

&nbsp;           )



&nbsp;           mistral\_result = await mistral\_task

&nbsp;           # ... process mistral\_result



&nbsp;           # ... (rest of the logic)



&nbsp;   except Exception as e:

&nbsp;       # ...

You will also need to run your Flask app with an ASGI server like Gunicorn with a Uvicorn worker (gunicorn --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app:app) to handle asynchronous requests properly.



#### **### \*\*Category 1: Conversational Intelligence \& Accuracy\*\***



These improvements will make the chatbot's responses more reliable, intelligent, and context-aware.



#### **#### \*\*1. Implement a User Feedback Mechanism (Thumbs Up/Down)\*\***



&nbsp; \* \*\*What:\*\* Add "üëç" and "üëé" icons to each AI response.

&nbsp; \* \*\*Why:\*\* This is the most direct way to gather data on answer quality. You can use this feedback to identify weaknesses in your prompts, your RAG context retrieval, or the underlying models.

&nbsp; \* \*\*How:\*\*

&nbsp;   1.  \*\*Frontend:\*\* In your `addMessage` function, append feedback buttons to the AI message bubble.

&nbsp;   2.  \*\*Backend:\*\* Create a new Flask endpoint (e.g., `/feedback`). When a user clicks a button, send the `session\_id`, the question, the answer, and the feedback (up/down) to this endpoint.

&nbsp;   3.  \*\*Storage:\*\* Store this feedback in a database (like the Redis or PostgreSQL instance you might use for chat history) for later analysis.



#### **#### \*\*2. Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\*\***



&nbsp; \* \*\*What:\*\* Improve how you find and use the context from your FAISS index.

&nbsp; \* \*\*Why:\*\* The quality of the context fed to the LLM directly determines the quality of the final answer. Simply taking the top 5 results isn't always optimal.

&nbsp; \* \*\*How:\*\*

&nbsp;     \* \*\*Re-ranking:\*\* After getting the initial 5 chunks from FAISS (which is fast), use a more sophisticated model (like a cross-encoder) to re-rank those 5 chunks for semantic relevance to the user's question before sending them to the LLM.

&nbsp;     \* \*\*Query Expansion:\*\* Before searching FAISS, use an LLM to rewrite the user's query. For example, if a user asks "sore throat," the LLM could expand it to "causes and treatments for pharyngitis or sore throat," leading to better document retrieval.



#### **#### \*\*3. Proactive "Next Step" Suggestions\*\***



&nbsp; \* \*\*What:\*\* Have the AI suggest relevant follow-up questions at the end of its response.

&nbsp; \* \*\*Why:\*\* This creates a more guided, seamless conversation. It keeps the user engaged and helps them explore topics they might not have thought to ask about.

&nbsp; \* \*\*How:\*\*

&nbsp;     \* Modify your final synthesis prompt in `app.py`. Add an instruction like: `"Finally, based on the answer, suggest 3 relevant follow-up questions the user might have. Format them as buttons or a simple list."`

&nbsp;     \* Your `formatAIMessage` function on the frontend can then be updated to style these suggestions as clickable "quick action" buttons.



#### **### \*\*Category 2: UI/UX and Frontend Polish\*\***



These changes will make the interface more intuitive, powerful, and pleasant to use.



#### **#### \*\*1. Full Markdown and Table Support\*\***



&nbsp; \* \*\*What:\*\* Render more complex markdown, especially tables, in the AI's response.

&nbsp; \* \*\*Why:\*\* Medical information is often best presented in tables (e.g., comparing symptoms, medication dosages, or treatment plans). This dramatically improves clarity.

&nbsp; \* \*\*How:\*\*

&nbsp;     \* Replace your manual `formatAIMessage` parsing with a robust, third-party library. \*\*`marked.js`\*\* is an excellent choice.

&nbsp;     \* Include the library via a CDN in `index.html`: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js"></script>`

&nbsp;     \* Update your `formatAIMessage` function to simply be:

&nbsp;       ```javascript

&nbsp;       function formatAIMessage(text) {

&nbsp;           // Sanitize to prevent XSS attacks when using a library

&nbsp;           return marked.parse(text, { breaks: true });

&nbsp;       }

&nbsp;       ```

&nbsp;     \* You would then update your final synthesis prompt to explicitly ask the AI to use markdown tables where appropriate.



#### **#### \*\*2. Persistent Conversation History Sidebar\*\***



&nbsp; \* \*\*What:\*\* Add a sidebar that lists the user's past conversations, allowing them to switch between them.

&nbsp; \* \*\*Why:\*\* This is a standard feature in modern chatbots. Users expect to be able to access and continue their previous discussions.

&nbsp; \* \*\*How:\*\*

&nbsp;   1.  \*\*UI Redesign:\*\* Change your `chat-container`'s parent to use flexbox, creating a sidebar on the left and the main chat window on the right.

&nbsp;   2.  \*\*Backend:\*\* When a new chat starts, save it to your database with a `session\_id` and a title (which you can ask the LLM to generate based on the first question).

&nbsp;   3.  Create endpoints to `GET` a list of all conversations for a user and to `GET` the full message history for a specific `session\_id`.

&nbsp;   4.  \*\*Frontend:\*\* When the page loads, fetch the list of conversations and display them in the sidebar. Clicking a conversation will fetch its history and populate the chat window.



#### **### \*\*Category 3: Security \& Production Readiness\*\***



These are critical for deploying a real, public-facing application, especially one that handles potentially sensitive medical topics.



#### **#### \*\*1. Containerize the Application with Docker\*\***



&nbsp; \* \*\*What:\*\* Create a `Dockerfile` for your application.

&nbsp; \* \*\*Why:\*\* Docker ensures your app runs the same way everywhere, from your local machine to the cloud. It simplifies deployment, scaling, and dependency management.

&nbsp; \* \*\*How:\*\* Create a `Dockerfile` in your root directory:

&nbsp;   ```dockerfile

&nbsp;   # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image

&nbsp;   FROM python:3.9-slim



&nbsp;   # Set the working directory in the container

&nbsp;   WORKDIR /app



&nbsp;   # Copy the requirements file into the container at /app

&nbsp;   COPY requirements.txt .



&nbsp;   # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt

&nbsp;   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt



&nbsp;   # Copy the rest of your application's code

&nbsp;   COPY . .



&nbsp;   # Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container

&nbsp;   EXPOSE 5000



&nbsp;   # Define environment variable for production

&nbsp;   ENV FLASK\_ENV production



&nbsp;   # Run app.py when the container launches using a production-ready server

&nbsp;   CMD \["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]

&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp;   \*You would also need to create a `requirements.txt` file (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`).\*



#### **#### \*\*2. PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Redaction\*\***



&nbsp; \* \*\*What:\*\* Automatically detect and remove personal information (names, phone numbers, emails) from user input before it's processed or logged.

&nbsp; \* \*\*Why:\*\* This is a crucial step towards privacy and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance. You should never log or send personal details to the LLM APIs if you can avoid it.

&nbsp; \* \*\*How:\*\*

&nbsp;     \* \*\*Simple Method:\*\* Use regular expressions (regex) to find and replace common PII patterns.

&nbsp;     \* \*\*Advanced Method:\*\* Use a dedicated service like \*\*Amazon Comprehend PII Detection\*\* or \*\*Google's Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API\*\*. These are more accurate than regex alone.



#### **#### \*\*3. Implement API Rate Limiting\*\***



&nbsp; \* \*\*What:\*\* Prevent users (or malicious bots) from spamming your `/ask` endpoint too frequently.

&nbsp; \* \*\*Why:\*\* This protects your application from abuse, controls API costs, and ensures fair usage for all users.

&nbsp; \* \*\*How:\*\* Use a Flask extension like \*\*`Flask-Limiter`\*\*. It's very easy to set up.

&nbsp;   ```python

&nbsp;   # In app.py

&nbsp;   from flask\_limiter import Limiter

&nbsp;   from flask\_limiter.util import get\_remote\_address



&nbsp;   # ...

&nbsp;   app = Flask(\_\_name\_\_)

&nbsp;   limiter = Limiter(

&nbsp;       get\_remote\_address,

&nbsp;       app=app,

&nbsp;       default\_limits=\["200 per day", "50 per hour"]

&nbsp;   )



&nbsp;   # Apply the rate limit to your endpoint

&nbsp;   @app.route('/ask', methods=\['POST'])

&nbsp;   @limiter.limit("10 per minute")

&nbsp;   def ask\_medprompt\_ai():

&nbsp;       # ... your code

&nbsp;   ```
